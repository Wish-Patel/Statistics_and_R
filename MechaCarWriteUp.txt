Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is considered to be not zero, because r-squared value is 0.71 which means roughly 71% of all mpg predictions will be correct using this linear model.
Also the p-value is 5.35x10^-11 which is significantly smaller than the assumed 0.05% of significance level, which is enough to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the slope is non-zero.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, the linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes more effectively than not because the r-squared value leads us to roughly 70% accuracy in our prediction.

Suspension Coil Summary:
With the suspension coil data we were able to determine the following:
Mean: 1499
Median: 1500
Variance: 62.3
Standard deviation: 7.89
With this information we can say the current manufacturing data does meet the design specifications as the varience of the suspension coils is roughly 63 PSI and it does not exceed 100 PSI as required.

Suspension Coil T-Test:
After performing a one sample t-test with a sample size of 50 on the suspension coil data, it is deteremined that the sample and the population means are not statistically different.
This is due to the assumed common 0.05% significance level which is surpassed by the p-value of the one sample t-test which was 0.64.

Comparing the performance of MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market:

In order to compare the performance of MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market collecting the following consumer data would be of interest:
- cost of the car (could break it down to used or brand new)
- fuel efficiency based on the number of miles put on said car
- other factors to consider would be: life span of the car, average maintenance cost, type of fuel the car takes (premium, regular) etc.


One sample T-test and multiple line regression would be to used to perfom statistical analysis for the collected data and determine their significance.
